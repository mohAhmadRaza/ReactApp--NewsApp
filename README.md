This project is a React-based web application that provides users with the latest news updates on various topics and top headlines. The app fetches data from a news API and displays the latest news 
articles with options to filter by category, region, or keyword.

## Features

- Fetches top headlines and news updates from multiple categories (e.g., technology, sports, business, health, entertainment etc.).
- Allows filtering news by categories.
- Responsive design for mobile and desktop.
- Easy-to-use interface to browse and read news articles.
- Next and back buttons

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the user interface.
- **News API**: For fetching real-time news updates.
- **Bootstrap**: For styling the app.
